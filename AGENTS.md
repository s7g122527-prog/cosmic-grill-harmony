Menu reference styling is scoped under `.foodio-menu` with semantic tokens in the global stylesheet, so other storefront and console sections retain their themes.
Generated menu cutouts are selected by dish name within the menu presentation only; unmatched dishes retain their original images so backend records, detail pages, and cart behavior stay unchanged.
